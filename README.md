# UDP-TCP-FILE
For all students, simple Socket programming homework. Work individually, no groups.<br>
Follow the example of socket programming in chapter 2 (java edition ppt), for implementing a clientserver simple program. Use the code for TCP and UDP.<br>
Your program must implement a simple request-response example:<br>
1) The client reads the line (request) from standard input, then sends it to the server.<br>
2) Server reads the line from the socket and prints the incoming message from the client.<br>
3) The server sends (response) back.<br>
The response is taken from a file stored in the server side. Think of it as <br>
DataBase table.<br>
For example: the client sends "B001", the server sends "Seat, Ibiza, 2009, <br>
Orange". In case there is no match request, send "Vehicle is not found".<br>
Sample database is shown in the table below.<br>
4) The client reads and prints the result from the socket.<br>
5) The client can make more requests, before closing the app.<br>
Submit a compressed folder that contains, the java code for client and server.<br>
**** You must Submit a Word or PDF document briefly explaining the steps of the code <br>
with screenshots of the output in different machines. Show the name of device and IP <br>
configuration for the network card. You must run the program on different devices<br>
